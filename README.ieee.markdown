# GibberLink Protocol: A File-Based Framework for Persistent AI-Driven Development

## Abstract
GibberLink is a file-based protocol designed to enhance collaborative coding environments using AI agents, such as GitHub Copilot. It employs a structured set of 11 YAML files to create a dynamic knowledge graph, facilitating persistent context management, traceability, and team collaboration across diverse projects.

## Introduction
This document outlines GibberLink, a protocol that integrates with GitHub Copilot to maintain project context, share knowledge among developers, and ensure adherence to established standards. It addresses the challenge of context loss in AI-assisted development by leveraging a shared file system.

## Methodology
- **Context Management**: Utilizes `000_context.yaml` as a central hub, updated by Copilot for each task.
- **Knowledge Graph**: Links entities (tasks, errors, insights) via `trace_id` and `related` fields.
- **Implementation**: Requires no external dependencies, relying on Copilot's native capabilities.

## Results
- **Efficiency**: Reduces onboarding time by providing instant context access via repository cloning.
- **Quality**: Ensures consistency through reusable patterns and shared standards.
- **Scalability**: Applicable to projects of varying complexity and team sizes.

## Future Work
Future enhancements include automated context archiving, integration with additional AI platforms, and empirical studies on its impact on development productivity.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`.
2. Initialize 11 YAML files in `.github/gibberlink/`.
3. Configure VSCode with `.vscode/settings.json` to reference `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
